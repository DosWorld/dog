Fixes/changes:
==============

DOG:
- Fixed init + mkudata (for env and alias blocks).
- Restored the old DOG prompt as the default when no PROMPT variable is set.
- Now using Borland C++ 3.1 to build, and Make instead of the batch files
  in previous versions.
- HH utilizes HELP to display more thorough help texts.
- Updated the IF syntax to be more versatile and to be similar with do.
- Implemented 44 and DO and IN and TI.

External commands:
- CP: now takes more options: -i (interactive), -f (force)
- VR: Fixed FreeDOS detection + print FD kernel string. Also added DOSbox detection.
- LS: -w option to display a wide listing with no details -z to show human readable sizes.

Utilities:
- HELP - Expanded help to fully document all commands and DOG itself. The manual.txt is
built with HELP.
- GENERR - is a silly utility which returns the error code given as arg 1. Used in
  testbat.dog to have predictable errorlevels.
