HOW TO COMPILE?
just do the following commands:
cd dog
make install

The DOG.COM is now located in dog\BIN.
The External commands are also located in dog\BIN
The utility programs are also located in dog\BIN

NOTE: The Makefiles assume your compiler is installed in C:\BORLANDC.
      You can use -DBORLAND=D:\MYBORLAND_DIR to override this.
      If you don't have Borland C/C++ 3.1, you can use Turbo C 2.01,
      but must use the tc201.mak Makefile and you must also have
      Turbo Assembler (2.01) installed.
      Other compilers & assemblers might work too, but you might have to
      adjust the Makefiles and the compiler switches.
