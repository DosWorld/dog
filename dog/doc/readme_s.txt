HOW TO COMPILE?
just do the following commands:
cd dog
make install

The DOG.COM is now located in dog\BIN.
The External commands are also located in dog\BIN
The utility programs are also located in dog\BIN

NOTE: The Makefiles assume your compiler is installed in C:\BORLANDC.
      You can use -DBORLAND=D:\MYBORLAND_DIR to override this.
      Note that Borland C/C++ 3.1 is required to compile the source code.
