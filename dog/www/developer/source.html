<P>
The code is made for (currently) MS-DOS 3.30.

<P> DOG is made on <A href="http://community.borland.com/" target="_top">Borland</a> C++ 3.1
Dog started out as a micro-C project but the compiler has some bugs, so I changed it.
Earlier (when DOG was made on the Micro-C compiler) DOG wouldn't compile
on other compilers. Now I think that it's pretty easy to port it to other
compilers as DOG follows the Borland syntax. (The memory model is TINY so it
will produce a .COM (memory image) file.

<P>Even though DOG runs on DOS versions 5 and up, it doesn't compete with
other command interpreters for those systems as it has no understanding on
memory other than conventional (yet).
<BR>
It has no memory management (yet). And I'm still in the wind trying to split
DOG in resident and transient parts. (Can anyone HELP??)
