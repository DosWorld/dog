<center><H3>What is DOG?</h3></center>
DOG is a program to replace MS-DOS:s default command interpreter. It is the
command interpreter that is responsible of displaying the prompt and acting
on your command. The most famous command interpreter for DOS is
<a href="http://www.jpsoft.com/4dosdes.htm" target="_top">4DOS</a>from
<A href="http://www.jpsoft.com/" target="_top">JP software</a>. Another one is the
<a href="http://www.gcfl.net/FreeDOS/command.com/" target="_top">FreeCOM</a> interpreter for
<a href="http://www.freedos.org" target="_top">FreeDOS</a> the Free version of M$-DOS.
<P>
Originally DOG was intended as a personal project, but then I thought,
<blockquote>
Why not distribute it free on the Internet?
</blockquote>
So that's why DOG is now a public project.

<center><H3>When will DOG be finished?</h3></center>
Well Hard to say for sure, but if things continue to proceed in this pace
I'd say I'll have the first version 1.0 by the end of 2000. DOG still has
a few things <A href="developer/todo.html" target="contentFrame">to implement</a> and some
<A href="developer/error.html" target="contentFrame">BUGs (= errors)</a>.

<HR>
<center><H3>Why use DOG?</h3></center>
DOG provides the same functionality as in COMMAND.COM, but with only 2 character names
to remember. Additionally DOG provides a command line help. Just type HH.
This feature is only available in MS-DOS versions 5.0 and above. And unlike
4DOS, DOG is COMPLETELY FREE and has a small size.
<HR>

<center><H3>How can I help?</h3></center>
You can hel by either just using DOG and reporting any errors you find, or you can
download the source and check for bugs. You can also join the developers, and (semi)
actively develop and enchance DOG.
Contact <a href="mailto:dog@users.sourceforge.net">Wolf Bergenheim</a> for more info.
